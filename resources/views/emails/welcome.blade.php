        Might want to play a bit hard to get. Dear Sir stroke Madam. Fire, exclamation mark. Fire, exclamation mark.
        Help me, exclamation mark. 123 Carrendon Road. Looking forward to hearing from you. All the best, Maurice Moss.
        Hello, IT. Have you tried forcing an unexpected reboot? It's my term for my time of the month. Oh. What time of
        the month? The weekend? It's like they're pally-wally with us when there's a problem with their printer, but
        once it's fixed... You mean 999. Yes, yes, I mean 999! Yeah, I know. That's the American one, you berk! I mean,
        they have no respect for us up there! No respect whatsoever! We're all just drudgeons to them!

        OK. Moss, what did you have for breakfast this morning? Smarties cereal. You can come down here any time and
        I'll be waiting for you! [slams down phone] That told her! So, remember the new number! 0118 999! 88199, 9119
        725! ... 3! Today I have a business empire the like of which the world has never seen the like of which. I hope
        it doesn't sound arrogant when I say that I am the greatest man in the world! I don't see how they couldn't just
        keep it as it was. How hard is it to remember 911? I'm going to murder you... You bloody woman! A gay musical,
        called Gay. That's quite gay. Gay musical? Aren't all musicals gay? This must be, like, the gayest musical ever.

        I'm going to murder you... You bloody woman! Carrie, Moss! First scene in Carrie! Oh. Okay I'm going to murder
        you... You bloody woman! How can you two... Don't Google the question, Moss! A gay musical, called Gay. That's
        quite gay. Gay musical? Aren't all musicals gay? This must be, like, the gayest musical ever. You're not
        comfortable with your sexuality? Oh, I'm very comfortable with my sexuality, I just don't want to be slapped in
        the face with their sexuality. Today I have a business empire the like of which the world has never seen the
        like of which. I hope it doesn't sound arrogant when I say that I am the greatest man in the world!
